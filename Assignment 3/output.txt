- artificial neural networks - artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal such systems learn ie progressively improve performance on tasks by considering examples generally without task-specific programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the results to identify cats in other images they do this without any a priori knowledge about cats eg that they have fur tails whiskers and cat-like faces instead they evolve their own set of relevant characteristics from the learning material that they process an ann is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons a simplified version of biological neurons in an animal brain each connection a simplified version of a synapse between artificial neurons can transmit a signal from one to another the artificial neuron that receives the signal can process it and then signal artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is calculated by a non-linear function of the sum of its inputs artificial neurons and connections typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold is the signal sent typically artificial neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention focused on matching specific tasks leading to deviations from biology anns have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis
